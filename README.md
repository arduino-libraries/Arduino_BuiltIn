Shell Arduino library to provide the standard built-in libraries.

The sole purpose of this library is to install the standard Arduino libraries which are typically included with the Arduino IDE. This is accomplished by defining the built-in libraries as dependencies in [the library.properties metadata file](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/library-specification/#library-metadata).
